## Project Structure and Description

*"Addressing both variable selection and misclassified responses with parametric and semiparametric methods"*, Hui Guo, Grace Y. Yi, and Boyu Wang. Submitted to *Bernoulli*.

This repository contains the implementation and example usage of the proposed method. The structure is as follows:

---

### `train/`

This folder contains the **core implementation** of the proposed methods:

- Model training and optimization
- Supporting utilities 


---

### `run.py`

This script serves as the **entry point** for running the proposed method. It performs:

- **Function Calls**  
  Executes the main training and evaluation logic using functions from the `train/` directory.

- **Argument Descriptions**

---

### `example.ipynb`

This Jupyter notebook includes:

1. **Data Simulation**  
   Generates synthetic data for evaluating the method.

2. **Method Usage**  
   Demonstrates how to apply the proposed method using the simulated data.
